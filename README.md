# TextAnalysis-URL-Extractor
Text Analysis &amp; URL Extractor: A Python tool for extracting article text from URLs and performing comprehensive text analysis. Use it to compute variables like sentiment scores, sentence length, and more. Simplify your text data extraction and analysis tasks.

# Text Analysis and URL Extractor

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to extract textual data from articles given a set of URLs and perform text analysis to compute various variables.

## Data Extraction
### Input
- For each article in the `input.xlsx` file, extract the article text and save it in a text file with the URL_ID as the file name.
- Ensure that the extraction includes only the article title and text, excluding headers, footers, and other irrelevant content.
- Use Python programming and libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Scrapy for data crawling.

## Data Analysis
- Perform textual analysis on the extracted texts.
- Compute variables specified in the "Text Analysis.docx" file.
- Use Python programming for the data analysis.

## Variables
1. POSITIVE SCORE
2. NEGATIVE SCORE
3. POLARITY SCORE
